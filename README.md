Enable AI to control your browser 🤖.

Browser use is the easiest way to connect your AI agents with the browser. If you have used Browser Use for your project feel free to show it off in our [Discord](https://link.browser-use.com/discord).

To learn more about the library, check out the [documentation 📕](https://docs.browser-use.com).

# Quick start

With pip:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

install playwright:

```bash
playwright install
```

Spin up your agent:

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from browser_use import Agent
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()

async def main():
    agent = Agent(
        task="Go to Reddit, search for 'browser-use' in the search bar, click on the first post and return the first comment.",
        llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o"),
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```

And don't forget to add your API keys to your `.env` file.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
```

For other settings, models, and more, check out the [documentation 📕](https://docs.browser-use.com).

### Test with UI

You can test [browser-use with a UI repository](https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui)

Or simply run the gradio example:

```
uv pip install gradio
```

```bash
python examples/gradio.py
```

## Contributing

We love contributions! Feel free to open issues for bugs or feature requests.

## Local Setup

To learn more about the library, check out the [local setup 📕](https://docs.browser-use.com/development/local-setup).

## Cooperations
We are forming a commission to define best practices for UI/UX design for browser agents. 
Together, we're exploring how software redesign improves the performance of AI agents and gives these companies a competitive advantage by designing their existing software to be at the forefront of the agent age. 

Email [Toby](mailto:tbiddle@loop11.com?subject=I%20want%20to%20join%20the%20UI/UX%20commission%20for%20AI%20agents&body=Hi%20Toby%2C%0A%0AI%20found%20you%20in%20the%20browser-use%20GitHub%20README.%0A%0A) to apply for a seat on the committee.
